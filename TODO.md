## 🔴 P0 — Right Now
- [ ] Build NEXT-ACTION.md system (auto-read at startup, always has 1 task)
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md startup to read TODO.md + NEXT-ACTION.md
- [ ] Update HEARTBEAT.md to reference TODO.md for "what to do when idle"

## 🟡 P1 — This Shift
- [ ] Audit all 10 running services for real functionality (not just "port open")

- [ ] Populate 6 unpublished PyPI packages (cocapn-skill-dsl, cocapn-flux-isa, cocapn-energy-flux, cocapn-telepathy, cocapn-shell-system, cocapn-edge-compute) — FM has tokens, bottle sent
- [ ] Verify beachcomb v2 doing real work (6-mode rotation, not just health checks)
- [ ] Run a real fleet roundtable or Ten Forward session
- [ ] Categorize remaining 191 uncategorized repos from audit

## 🟢 P2 — Backlog (Don't Start Until P0/P1 Done)
- [ ] Wire agent-api into keeper for real agent discovery
- [ ] Test inbetweener pattern (big model storyboards, Seed decomposes)
- [ ] Improve holodeck-rust (new rooms, better poker AI, story circle)
- [ ] Matrix federation — set up Conduwuit per agent
- [ ] Write Captain's Log entries
- [ ] PurplePincher builder agent — IO from prompts/pics to 3D APIs
